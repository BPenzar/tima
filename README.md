## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

To test TIMA, clone the repository, install the latest version of the Ionic CLI and run:

```bash
ionic start mySuperApp super
```

```bash
ionic serve
```

## Pages

The app loads with the `FirstRunPage` set to `TutorialPage` as the default. If
the user has already gone through this page once, it will be skipped the next
time they load the app.

The entry and main pages can be configured easily by updating the corresponding
variables in
[src/pages/index.ts](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters/blob/master/ionic-angular/official/super/src/pages/index.ts).

Please read the
[Pages](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters/tree/master/ionic-angular/official/super/src/pages)
readme, and the readme for each page in the source for more documentation on
each.
